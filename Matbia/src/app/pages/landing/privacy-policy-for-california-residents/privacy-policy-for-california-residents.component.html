    <p>
      This <strong>Privacy Policy for California Resident</strong>s supplements the information contained in the Matbia
      Family of companies (Matbia Services, Matbia Charities)
      <a href="#" [routerLink]="['/privacy-and-policy']">general privacy policy</a> and applies solely to all visitors,
      users, and others who reside in the State of California ("consumers" or "you"). We adopt this notice to comply
      with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning
      when used in this Policy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where noted in this Policy, the CCPA temporarily exempts personal information reflecting a written or verbal
      business-to-business communication ("<strong>B2B personal information</strong>") from some its requirements.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-center">Information We Collect</h4>

    <p>
      We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being
      associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or
      device ("<strong>personal information</strong>"). Personal information does not include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Publicly available information from government records.</li>
      <li>Deidentified or aggregated consumer information.</li>
      <li>
        Information excluded from the CCPA's scope, like:

        <ul>
          <li>
            health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
            (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA), clinical trial data, or other
            qualifying research data.
          </li>

          <li>
            personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting
            Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and
            the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994.

    <h4 class="text-center">Sharing Personal Information</h4>

    <p>
      We may share your personal information by disclosing it to a third party for a business purpose. We only make
      these business purpose disclosures under written contracts that describe the purposes, require the recipient to
      keep the personal information confidential, and prohibit using the disclosed information for any purpose except
      performing the contract. In the preceding twelve (12) months, Company has not disclosed personal information for a
      business purpose[ to the categories of third parties indicated in the chart below.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-center">Your Rights and Choices</h4>

    <p>
      The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This
      section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em> <strong>Right to Know and Data Portability</strong> </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your
      personal information over the past 12 months (the "right to know"). Once we receive your request and confirm your
      identity (see
      <mark (click)="scrollTo(exercisingRightsKnowDelete)">Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete</mark>), we will
      disclose to you:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
      <li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>

      <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
      <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>

      <li>
        If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:
        <ul>
          <li>sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and</li>
          <li>
            disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of
            recipient obtained.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do not provide a right to know or data portability disclosure for B2B personal information.</p>

    <p>
      <em> <strong>Right to Delete</strong> </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and
      retained, subject to certain exceptions (the "right to delete"). Once we receive your request and confirm your
      identity (see
      <mark (click)="scrollTo(exercisingRightsKnowDelete)">Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete</mark>), we will
      review your request to see if an exception allowing us to retain the information applies. We may deny your
      deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you
        requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you,
        fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise
        perform our contract with you.
      </li>

      <li>
        Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute
        those responsible for such activities.
      </li>

      <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>

      <li>
        Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise
        another right provided for by law.
      </li>

      <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code ยง 1546 et. seq.).</li>

      <li>
        Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that
        adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render
        impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
      </li>

      <li>
        Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship
        with us.
      </li>

      <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>

      <li>
        Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you
        provided it.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      We will delete or deidentify personal information not subject to one of these exceptions from our records and will
      direct our service providers to take similar action.
    </p>

    <p>We do not provide these deletion rights for B2B personal information.</p>

      requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal
      information associated with that specific account.]

    </p>

    <p>
      Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response
      we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability
      requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow
      you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically, PDF.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive,

    <p #personalInformation>
      <em> <strong>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</strong> </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are age 16 or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the
      "right to opt-out"). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years
      old, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the consumer who is between
      13 and 15 years old, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years old. Consumers who opt-in to
      personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
    </p>

    <p>
      To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting
      the following Internet Web page link:
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-center">
      <a href="mailto:info@matbia.com">Do Not Sell My Personal Information</a>
    </h4>

    <p>
      Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize
      personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any
      time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@matbia.com">info&#64;matbia.com</a>:
    </p>

    <p>
      You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal
      information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-center">Non-Discrimination</h4>

    <p>
      We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will
      not:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>

      <li>
        Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other
        benefits, or imposing penalties.
      </li>

      <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>

      <li>
        Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of
        goods or services.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices,
      rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal
      information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a
      financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time
    </p>
